/*

- [ ] when stats/grid added, `#methodical-spelling-bee` is so tall that it overflow the footer
	probably a css issue, like nyt is expecting content area to be an exact height or something

- [ ] add colors, like green when 100% of pair found

- [ ] make sure wordlist grows when needed as more words added
	"you have words" gets cut off when make shorter than 350px, might need to adjust its styles to adapt

- [ ] maybe add body class so can just make the tmp styles permanent, but only apply while node is running or whatever

- [ ] make responsive

- [ ] make two letter list two columns, or 3, or auto
